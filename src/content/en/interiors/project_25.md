This apartment interior in Almaty is designed specifically for a young man who values comfort and contemporary style. The space combines simplicity with bold contrasts and elegant textures.

In the living room, a grey sofa accented with graphic decorative elements takes center stage, complemented by brass highlights and warm wooden surfaces. An impressive bar area featuring black marble and golden details creates the perfect setting for socializing with friends.

The bedroom, with its soft palette and minimalist design, offers a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Every detail of this project reflects the taste and lifestyle of its owner.
