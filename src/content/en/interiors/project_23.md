144.3 m² apartment designed for a young family of three. Located on the fifth floor of a modern residential complex in Almaty’s green district, the space opens to serene mountain views.

The apartment was delivered as a raw shell. With structural beams exposed and ceiling height limited to 3.15 m, the design focused on spatial clarity and visual lightness. Load-bearing elements were integrated into the decorative logic through rhythmical molding lines—refining proportions without lowering ceilings.

White walls and pale marble floors set a neutral base, allowing furniture and objects to lead the narrative. A deep violet sofa, dark matte glass, and curated art pieces reflect the family’s connection to travel and contemporary culture. The tall doors—2.65 meters with brass inlay—anchor the composition and subtly inform the tone of the entire space.

Every room is defined yet fluid. The kitchen, both sculptural and functional, became a favorite of the client. The boy’s room balances grey tones with personal art and playful details—like a vintage suitcase stack repurposed as a side table.

This project began with a request: “We want a home in the style of Asel Baimakhan.” What followed was a dialogue between personal aesthetics and architectural constraints, resulting in a space that quietly carries both.
