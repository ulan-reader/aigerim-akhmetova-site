The project represents an elegant interior where every detail is thoughtfully crafted to create an atmosphere of refinement and comfort. A striking focal point is the decorative wall featuring cranes, executed in relief technique, adding depth and expressiveness to the living room. The interior palette is built upon calm, muted tones, contrasted by vibrant accents—such as a deep terracotta armchair, providing a bold highlight within the space.

Lighting has been carefully selected to ensure a cozy ambiance, with a designer chandelier serving as the centerpiece that sets the mood for the entire area. Textiles and decorative items are chosen to enhance stylistic coherence and comfort. The use of high-quality materials and the skillful blending of textures underline the sophistication of the interior, creating a harmonious and well-rounded environment.
