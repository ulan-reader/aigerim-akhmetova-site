Soft Coffee Tones, Natural Materials, and Brass Accents

This project was designed for a young couple who wanted something timeless, soft, and natural. They chose a neoclassical style with a contemporary twist, focusing on natural materials, refined details, and a warm coffee-toned color palette.

The kitchen and living areas form the heart of the home. The kitchen is a showpiece, with classic white cabinetry, striking natural stone countertops, and backsplash in bold black-and-gray veins. Golden hardware and a sculptural chandelier add elegance and warmth. The dining area features a dark round table, soft textured chairs, and large windows that fill the space with light.

A unique design feature runs through the hallway and living room — a thin brass strip integrated into the walls at mid-height. This detail visually connects all the spaces and gives the apartment a sense of rhythm and harmony. The furniture is cozy yet refined, in neutral shades, with subtle textures that add depth.



The master bedroom continues the calm, elegant mood. A tall upholstered headboard in soft fabric, decorative wall moldings, and vertical mirrors create a sense of height and balance. The bedding and textiles stay within the same soft beige and mauve palette, and golden candleholders add a warm, intimate touch.

The children’s rooms are thoughtfully designed: one with twin beds and a soft palette of grays and neutrals, perfect for both rest and study. The second is more playful and feminine, in powdery pinks and creamy textures, with artistic plaster details and curved furniture that make the space both elegant and child-friendly.

The main bathrooms feature natural marble, light walls, and black fixtures for contrast. The guest toilet is a standout space, with glossy black marble halfway up the walls, bold brass sconces, and a custom floor design using black and white stone in a playful circular pattern.

Every room in this apartment speaks the same design language — modern classic, natural elegance, and timeless beauty. Carefully selected materials, custom details, and soft tones create a peaceful, stylish home for a young and modern family.
