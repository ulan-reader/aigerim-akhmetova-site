This luxurious 1450 m² residence in Almaty is designed for a young entrepreneur and art collector. The interior draws inspiration from classic French apartments, featuring traditional elements such as moldings, marble fireplaces, parquet floors, and sophisticated chandeliers, blended seamlessly with contemporary furnishings.

The house layout follows feng shui principles. The basement includes a relaxation area complete with a sauna, hammam, massage room, and utility spaces. On the first floor, there is a living room with a fireplace, dining room, kitchen, library, guest bedroom, gym, and a two-car garage. The second floor houses private bedrooms for family members, each with its own bathroom and walk-in closet, along with a communal relaxation space featuring a TV area and library.

The color palette varies from whites and greys in common areas to soft pastel shades like powder pink, blue, and green in private rooms. Great attention was paid to intricate details, from custom parquet patterns to hand-painted walls in the master bedroom and bathroom. Bespoke furniture pieces, such as vintage-style sideboards and antiqued mirrors, add distinctive charm. The interiors are further enriched by artworks from Kazakhstani artists and sculptors, reflecting the country's cultural heritage.

This project beautifully harmonizes classic French elegance with modern elements, creating a sophisticated and functional space that reflects the owner’s personality.
