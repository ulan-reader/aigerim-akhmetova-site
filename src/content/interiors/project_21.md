A 291.5 m² duplex designed for a young family with two daughters. Set atop a seven-story residence in the foothills of Almaty, the apartment unites two raw-level units into a calm and orderly whole.

The first level hosts public spaces: a living room, kitchen, laundry, guest bath. Below — private quarters, bedrooms, dressing rooms. Circulation was rethought entirely. The layout responds to daily rhythms: a spacious kitchen, a generous walk-in, a sunlit bathroom.

Neoclassical gestures are softened — cornices and molding in muted tones, contrasted with sculptural ceilings and tailored light. The material language remains tactile: oak parquet, marble with blue veining, brushed brass. Paintwork blends ceiling and wall, shifting perception of height and space.

A children’s room glows in soft pink — not just walls, but the ceiling too. The guest bathroom, in contrast, bursts with bold turquoise. Precision meets warmth. Restraint meets detail.

The project reflects the clients’ desire for quiet elegance — with moments of surprise.
