This project involved the thoughtful renovation and expansion of a family home in the Edelweiss cottage settlement in Almaty, adapted for a growing household. Initially intended as a light refresh with updated textiles, the scope evolved into a more ambitious transformation led by designer Assel Baimakhan, including architectural extensions to increase living space.

The interior blends French classical style with colonial and Indochinese influences, reflecting the owners’ refined taste and their collection of furniture from Moissonnier, Roche Bobois, and decor by Mis en Demeure. Special attention was given to the preservation and restoration of antique pieces, giving the home a sense of heritage and character.

The layout features a spacious basement with a pool and steam rooms, communal areas on the ground floor, and private bedrooms on the upper level. The living room incorporates elements of local tradition, including a corner with authentic Kazakh-style topchans. Children's rooms are designed in a neutral contemporary style, tailored to each child’s personality.

This home is a refined balance of tradition and modernity—elegant, warm, and perfectly suited for the life of a large and dynamic family.
