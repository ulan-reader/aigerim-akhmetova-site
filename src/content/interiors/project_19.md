American Style in Kazakhstan
 The owners of this villa in the Green Hills neighborhood of Almaty, Kazakhstan, had a clear request for architect and interior designer Assel Baimakhan: to create interiors in the American style, offering a warm, welcoming space for the entire family—parents and four children.
“They asked me to design a unique personal space based on their wishes, including a library with a reading area, a home office, individual bedrooms for each family member, and dedicated rooms for household staff,” explains Assel Baimakhan. “To make everything fit, we had to completely rethink the house: we expanded it, added an attic floor, and demolished several walls.”
The result was a doubling of the usable space—now 635 square meters plus an attic—and every client request fulfilled. For the lady of the house, American style represents timeless comfort and the idea of a true “dream home.” Her inspiration came from two iconic films: Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Pretty Woman. It was a major challenge, but thanks to the strong rapport with the clients, the architect successfully brought the vision to life.
Layout of the Dream Home
 The house unfolds across two levels, plus an attic floor. On the ground floor, a foyer leads to a guest bathroom and a guest cloakroom. From the vestibule, an arched opening leads to a spacious hall with a staircase to the second floor. From the hallway, portals open into the dining room, which connects to a large living area. The living and dining zones are visually separated by a beam and a semicircular bay window.
The kitchen—with a large central island—is situated behind a glass partition that separates it from the dining area and opens onto a summer terrace. Also on the ground floor, in a newly added wing, are a spa, a relaxation room, and a laundry.
On the second floor, a large salon includes the library area, the owner's home office, and a terrace. This floor also houses one child’s bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and walk-in closet, as well as the master bedroom, which features a spacious wardrobe and a bathroom located within the bay window. Two more children’s bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms are located in the added wing.
The attic level opens with a generous entry and a hallway leading to a guest bedroom with private bathroom and closet. There’s also a large dressing room and a staff room with its own bathroom.
A Timeless Atmosphere
 The timeless feel of this American-style Kazakh home is enhanced by the color palette chosen by the architect: soft, serene shades of gray, beige, and blush, offset in some rooms by deep blue and turquoise accents. Almost all of the furniture and décor—built-ins, upholstered pieces, tables, and the kitchen set—were custom-designed by Assel Baimakhan’s team.
For decoration, the team incorporated works by sculptor Eduard Kazaryan and paintings by Aruzhan Zhumabekov. The fireplace area in the living room was designed to blend harmoniously with the home’s overall style, and the second-floor library features a unique wall-to-wall bookcase designed specifically for the space.
