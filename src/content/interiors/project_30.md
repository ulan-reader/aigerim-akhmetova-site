This 95 square meter (approx. 1,022 sq ft) apartment was designed for a young couple who wanted a dark and modern look. They didn’t like bright interiors and asked for something bold, cozy, and stylish.

The living room is connected to the kitchen, forming one open space. The main sofa is from the Italian brand Meridiani and adds a light contrast to the rich, dark walls. All built-in furniture and panels are made from MDF with walnut veneer, developed in a special dark chocolate color that took time to perfect. The ceiling features a unique artistic detail in soft green, echoing the furniture’s rounded shapes.

The kitchen is sleek and minimal, with hidden appliances and a peninsula with black stools. A decorative black screen separates the kitchen from the living area without blocking the light.
