This 180-square-meter apartment in Almaty serves as both the personal residence and creative canvas of designer Asel Baimakhan. Acting as both client and designer, she transformed the space into a reflection of individuality and artistic expression.

Embracing the existing architectural elements, Baimakhan highlighted structural features like ceiling beams and a prominent column, adorning them with gypsum hemispheres and a unique capital resembling wood shavings. A curved partition, clad in carved wooden panels, separates the living area, while diagonal herringbone parquet flooring adds dynamic texture.

The neutral beige backdrop of the living room and kitchen provides a canvas for bold black accents and vibrant furniture pieces. A standout feature is a chandelier cast from her daughter's hands, adding a surreal touch to the combined bedroom and dressing area.

Baimakhan integrates elements of Kazakh culture through modern interpretations of traditional felt rugs, known as syrmaks, and a curated collection of local ceramics. Custom-designed furniture and bespoke decor throughout the apartment underscore a commitment to craftsmanship and personal storytelling.

This project exemplifies a harmonious blend of contemporary design with cultural heritage, creating a space that is both functional and deeply personal.
