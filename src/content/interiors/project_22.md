Mountain House / Almaty, Kazakhstan
686.9 m² two-story residence with a basement spa and mountain-facing terrace. Designed and built under the direction of the author.

The site—quiet, elevated, green—set the tone for the entire project. Originally intended as a renovation, the existing house was eventually dismantled in favor of a structure better aligned with the family’s needs, climate, and light.

The layout follows a clear logic: private spaces above, public spaces below. The living area is divided into zones for social flow. The basement becomes a private wellness space, housing a pool, sauna, and hammam—relocated indoors due to the cool mountain air.

Interior language: marble floors, veneered and gypsum-clad walls, natural oak parquet upstairs. Earth tones dominate, echoing the surrounding landscape. Plants were intentionally introduced throughout—turning the home into a quiet extension of the outdoors.

Furnishings were selected in calm, tactile finishes. A marble “butterfly” fireplace anchors the primary bedroom. The staircase, however, is the project’s heart—both technically challenging and visually central.

A family home shaped by nature, grounded in practicality, softened by detail.
