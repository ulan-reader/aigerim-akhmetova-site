This unique apartment-office in Almaty, designed by Asel Baimakhan, occupies the former roof space of a multi-story residential building. Originally an unused attic, it has been transformed into a compact yet expressive living and working environment tailored for a modern bachelor.

The main challenge was architectural: converting an irregular space with sloped ceilings and structural limitations into a comfortable and stylish apartment. Baimakhan embraced the constraints by creating a layout with distinct zones for living, working, and relaxing. The space now includes a living area, compact kitchen, workspace, bedroom, and even a small terrace.

The interior palette leans toward calm, muted tones, with deep green walls setting a dramatic tone in the living area, softened by warm textures and ambient lighting. A mix of vintage and custom-made furniture adds character, while sculptural forms and unexpected details—such as a freestanding bathtub in the bedroom—give the space a bold, artistic identity.

Designed for a client with a dynamic lifestyle, the project balances function and style in a small footprint. The result is a minimalist yet emotionally rich apartment that feels both grounded and imaginative—ideal for a bachelor who values individuality, art, and a sense of retreat within the city.
