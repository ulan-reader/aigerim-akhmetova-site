This light-filled apartment was designed as a calm and elegant space with a strong sense of purity and airiness. The client requested a very bright interior — and this idea shaped the entire concept. Natural light plays a leading role, enhanced by pale wood floors, creamy wall tones, and soft textures throughout the home.
The heart of the apartment is the open-plan kitchen and living area. A large sliding glass partition with black framing allows the space to be either completely open or divided when privacy is needed. In the open position, the apartment feels spacious and connected; when closed, the space transforms into a quiet lounge or guest zone.

Black accents — from the slim-framed glazing to the TV and spotlights — are used thoughtfully to add contrast and balance to the light palette. A vivid piece of contemporary art adds a colorful focal point and brings a layer of individuality to the interior.

The master bedroom continues the calm mood with warm neutrals, soft upholstery, and light textures. A comfortable reading corner near the window and custom cabinetry make the space both cozy and functional. From the bedroom, you enter a private walk-in closet and a master bathroom clad in rare, elegant blue marble — a material chosen for its unique natural pattern and tranquil atmosphere.
The guest bathroom also features a remarkable natural stone with expressive golden veins. Custom MDF wall panels in muted tones were added to create visual rhythm and support the stone’s dramatic texture. Every material was selected for its timeless beauty and tactile feel.
This apartment is a refined example of minimalism enriched with emotion — a quiet, thoughtful space where light, texture, and color live in perfect harmony.
